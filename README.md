## Crawler
- [ChainWalker](https://github.com/0xsha/ChainWalker) - ChainWalker is a smart contract scraper which uses RCP/IPC calls to extract the information. A small tool that can help us find contracts, extract the EVM code, and disassemble the opcodes. It allows us to select specific blocks or even specific contract balances.
