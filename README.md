## Malicious-based Dataset
A malicious or dodgy smart contract is a self-executing piece of code on a blockchain that is designed to exploit users, typically by gaining unauthorized access to and spending their digital tokens. These contracts often appear legitimate but contain hidden functionalities that, once interacted with, can lead to the loss of your assets. It's crucial to understand that such contracts generally only endanger the specific tokens you've granted them permission to access, not your entire cryptocurrency portfolio or other unrelated digital assets. If you suspect interaction with a malicious smart contract, immediate action, such as revoking allowances granted to it, is vital to protect your funds.

## Vulnerability-based Dataset
A vulnerable smart contract contains flaws or errors in its code or design that can be exploited by malicious actors, leading to unintended behavior, financial losses, or unauthorized access. Unlike malicious smart contracts, which are designed with ill intent from the start, vulnerable contracts typically arise from programming mistakes, oversights in security practices, or a lack of thorough testing. Common vulnerabilities include reentrancy attacks, integer overflows/underflows, access control issues, and susceptible timestamp dependencies. Once deployed on an immutable blockchain, these flaws become permanent, making it critical for developers to rigorously audit and test contracts before deployment to mitigate potential risks and ensure the security of user funds and data.
